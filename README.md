# Life

A quick lesson, cooperatively written with a student, about a trivial
implementation of Conway's Game Of Life in different languages.

Informal testing on my MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) in "benchmark mode"
with 50,000 iteratations, revealed the following fairly surprising times:
- life-js: 2.009 s
- life-rust: 0.882 s
- life-c++: 0.489 s
